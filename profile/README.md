# FAQ
## About us
The Aridity Team is a group/team (hence the name) of developers who mainly develops in .NET (VB and C#) or C++. We also develop games based on the Source engine.

## How to join us?
Wanna join? Don't worry, you don't need to be a software developer/engineer to be in the gang. You can provide The Aridity Team sounds, graphics, voice, design shit or whatever and more!

## Can we partner?
Short answer is No. Because of the events that happened back then, The Aridity Team currently doesn't accept partnerships/sponsorships from third-party organizations unless its very trusted.

## o shi its a bug!!!@!111!!!
Our software can be improved, and the team is ready to do so! If you have encountered an issue please report them to the Aridity Team immediately. We wanted our software to be more stable and more complex
